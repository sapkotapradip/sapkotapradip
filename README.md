## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sorghum breeding lab at Texas A&M University
# ðŸŒ± I use R, Python, Linux, and command lines for data handling and statistical modeling to answer major research questions
# ðŸŒ± My broad research areas in terms of keywords: genomic prediction, phenomic prediction, elite hybrids, introgression populations, ideotype based breeding
# ðŸ‘¯ I am passionate about plant breeding, genomics, phenomics, machine learning, statistical modeling, and/or data science
# ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, Plant breeding, predictive modeling, breeding methodologies esp for hybrid crops
# ðŸ“« How to reach me: prdp@tamu.edu
# âš¡ Fun fact: Have you ever had fried hornets ? you'll like it
