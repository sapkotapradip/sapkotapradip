# Hi there
My name is Pradip Sapkota -currently a PhD student in sorghum breeding lab at Texas A&M University. My research focus is to strengthen predictive breeding strategies for grain composition traits and agronomic performance in grain sorghum hybrids. I am interested in testing range of statistical models (non-linear and linear) in training prediction equations to support breeding pipeline. In adddition, I have integrated NIR based omics data into genomic models to predict hybrid performance on sorghum for the first time. The publication is under review. All of my codes for performing prediction modeling will be made public soon. I am expecting to finish my degree by mid-2025 and will be exploring opportunities in industry with focus on plant breeding, genomics, predictive breeding and/or analytics. I can be reached out at prdp@tamu.edu as well as at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sapkotapradip/ in linkedIn.
